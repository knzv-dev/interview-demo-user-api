# User Api
Example microservice, that I had to write in one of my interviews 

## Initial Task
Write a microservice that stores user records
The user must be able to:
* create a record (register)
* search for an entry by email
* It should be possible to add business validation rules.
At the moment, there is one - you can't register a user younger than 15 years old,
but they might be added in the future.

The service must store the following data about the user:
* name
* date of birth
* email
